# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** [DATE]

This Privacy Policy explains how Riva ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our AI email scheduling assistant service.

## What Riva Does

Riva is an AI assistant that helps you schedule meetings. When someone CCs your Riva assistant on an email thread, it reads the conversation, checks your calendar availability, proposes meeting times, and creates calendar events once confirmed.

## Information We Collect

### Account Information
When you sign up, we collect:
- **Email address and name** from your Google account (for identity verification only)
- **Phone number** (if you choose SMS notifications)
- **Telegram Chat ID** (if you choose Telegram notifications)

### Assistant Account
Riva requires you to connect a separate Google account as your "assistant." This is a different account from your personal Google account. For this assistant account, we request access to:
- **Gmail** (read, send, and manage emails)
- **Google Calendar** (view availability and create events)
- **Google Contacts** (look up attendee information)

**Important:** We do NOT have access to your personal email inbox. We only access the assistant account you explicitly connect.

### Scheduling Data
When processing scheduling requests, we collect and store:
- Email threads where your assistant is CC'd (subject, body, participants)
- Meeting attendee information (names and email addresses)
- Meeting details (title, duration, proposed and confirmed times)
- Your scheduling preferences (working hours, timezone, buffer times)

### Communication Data
We store messages exchanged for scheduling confirmations:
- SMS messages sent via Twilio
- Telegram messages sent via our bot

### User Preferences
You can configure:
- Working hours and timezone
- Zoom personal meeting link
- Meeting duration defaults
- Scheduling rules and preferences

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:
- Process and coordinate meeting scheduling requests
- Send emails from your assistant account
- Check your calendar availability
- Create calendar events with video conferencing links
- Send SMS or Telegram notifications for confirmations
- Analyze email content using AI to understand scheduling intent

| **Twilio** | Phone number, message content | SMS delivery (if you choose SMS) |
| **Telegram** | Chat ID, message content | Message delivery (if you choose Telegram) |

### What We Do NOT Do
- Sell your personal information

## Data Security

We protect your information by:

- Limiting access to authorized personnel only

## Data Retention

You can request deletion of your data at any time by contacting us.

## Your Rights

- **Access** your personal data
- **Delete** your account and associated data
- **Revoke** Google OAuth access at any time via your Google account settings
- **Opt out** of SMS by replying STOP to any message

## SMS/Text Message Terms

If you choose SMS notifications:
- **Consent:** By providing your phone number and selecting SMS notifications, you consent to receive scheduling-related text messages
- **Message types:** Appointment confirmations, scheduling options, reminders
- **Frequency:** Varies based on your scheduling activity (typically 2-10 messages per scheduling request)
- **Rates:** Message and data rates may apply
- **Opt-out:** Reply STOP to any message to unsubscribe. We will confirm your opt-out and stop sending messages within 10 days
