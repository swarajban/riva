## Section 1: Hero

### Headline
**Never schedule another meeting yourself.**

### Subheadline
Riva is your AI scheduling assistant. CC it on any email thread and it handles the back-and-forth, finds times that work, and books meetings—all with your approval via text.

### CTA Button
**Sign Up — $399/month**

### Trust Line
Fully automated. Human-level quality. You stay in control.

> **Designer Note:** Hero should feel premium and clean. Consider a subtle animation showing an email thread with Riva responding. No stock photos of people—focus on the product interaction.

---

## Section 2: How It Works

### Section Header
**Scheduling that takes seconds, not hours**

### Step 1
**CC Riva on your email**

When you need to schedule a meeting, just add Riva to the thread. It reads the context—who's involved, what the meeting is about, and any time preferences mentioned.

> **Designer Note:** Show a simple email compose with "riva@yourcompany.com" being added to CC.

### Step 2
**Riva handles the conversation**

Within minutes, Riva replies with available times based on your calendar. It handles responses, counter-proposals, and follow-ups—even when the other party's assistant gets involved.

> **Designer Note:** Show an email thread with Riva proposing times and the external party responding.

### Step 3
**Confirm via text, meeting is booked**

Before anything goes on your calendar, you get a text confirmation. Reply Y to book, suggest changes, or cancel—all from your phone. The calendar invite goes out immediately with a Zoom link.

> **Designer Note:** Show SMS interface with the confirmation message format:
> ```
> 📅 You <> Sarah Chen
> Tue 1/7, 2pm PT | 30min | Zoom
> Reply Y to send, N to cancel, or make changes
> ```

## Section 3: Key Features

### Section Header
**Built for professionals who value their time**

---

### Feature 1: Email-Native
**Works where you already work**

No new app to learn. No dashboard to check. Riva operates inside Gmail—just CC it on threads and it handles the rest. Maintains proper email threading so conversations stay organized.

---

### Feature 2: You Stay in Control
**Every booking requires your approval**

Nothing goes on your calendar without your say-so. Get a text confirmation before every meeting is booked. Change the time, adjust the duration, add a location, or cancel—all via text.

**Supported commands:**
- `Y` — Book the meeting
- `30` — Change to 30-minute meeting
- `@ Blue Bottle Coffee` — Add location
- `No zoom` — Remove video link
- `Tomorrow` — Find new times for tomorrow

---

### Feature 3: Handles Complexity
**Sophisticated coordination, not just scheduling**

Riva handles the situations other tools can't:
- **Multi-party meetings** with automatic attendee detection
- **External assistants** who coordinate on someone's behalf
- **Counter-proposals** from either side
- **Reschedules and cancellations** that require your approval
- **Stale availability** when your calendar changes between proposal and confirmation

---

### Feature 4: Bring Your Own Account
**Your assistant, your brand, your trust**

Connect your own Gmail account for Riva to use. Emails come from your domain (riva@yourcompany.com), not a shared assistant address. Your contacts see communication from your organization—building trust, not confusion.

Ideal for companies who want an AI assistant that looks and feels like a real team member.

---

### Feature 5: Configurable Automation
**From fully automated to confirm-every-step**

Choose your comfort level:

| Level | Email Approval | Booking Approval | Best For |
|-------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| **Full Auto** | No | Yes (via text) | Experienced users |
| **Review Emails** | Yes | Yes | New users, high-stakes scheduling |

Start with more oversight, then dial it back as you build confidence.

---

### Feature 6: Optimized for Correctness
**Built to never make mistakes**

Other AI assistants prioritize speed. Riva prioritizes accuracy:

- **No same-day scheduling** — Meetings are always for tomorrow or later
- **Buffer time respected** — Configurable gaps between meetings
- **Timezone awareness** — All times displayed in your timezone
- **Tentative events honored** — Treats unconfirmed calendar blocks as busy
- **Professional communication** — Emails that sound like you, not a robot

---

### Feature 7: Smart Customization
**Keyword rules for different meeting types**

Define rules that trigger automatically:

*Example: When someone says "time to connect"*
→ 30-minute meeting
→ Only Monday/Wednesday
→ Between 2-5pm

Set your working hours, buffer times, and default meeting lengths. Riva adapts to how you work.

---

## Section 6: FAQ

### Section Header
**Questions**

---

**How does Riva access my calendar?**

You connect a Gmail account for Riva to use as your assistant. This account has access to Gmail (to send/receive emails) and Google Calendar (to check availability and create events). Your personal login is separate and only used to verify your identity.

---

**Does Riva send emails automatically?**

By default, Riva sends scheduling emails after a short delay (2-7 minutes) to feel natural. You can enable email approval mode to review every outbound email before it's sent—useful when you're getting started or for high-stakes scheduling.

---

**What if I need to reschedule or cancel?**

Just reply to the text confirmation with your changes. Say "tomorrow" to find new times, "45" to change duration, or "N" to cancel. If the other party requests changes, Riva will text you for approval before taking action.

---

**How is my data protected?**

Riva only accesses the Gmail account you connect as your assistant. We don't store email content long-term—it's processed to understand scheduling context and then discarded. Calendar data is accessed in real-time via Google's API, not stored.

---

**Can I use Riva with Outlook or other email providers?**

Currently, Riva only works with Gmail and Google Calendar. Outlook/Microsoft 365 support is on our roadmap.

---

**What's the cancellation policy?**

Cancel anytime from your account settings. You'll retain access through the end of your billing period. No long-term contracts, no cancellation fees.

---

**Is there a free trial?**

We don't offer a free trial, but you can cancel within the first 14 days for a full refund if Riva isn't right for you.

## Additional Designer Notes

### Visual Identity
- **Tone:** Premium, professional, confident
- **Colors:** Suggest a clean palette—deep navy or charcoal with a single accent color
- **Typography:** Modern sans-serif, generous whitespace
- **Imagery:** Product interactions (email threads, SMS confirmations, calendar events)—no stock photos of people smiling at laptops

### Interactions
- Sticky navigation that highlights current section
- Smooth scroll to anchor links
- CTA button visible on scroll (sticky or repeated)
- Consider subtle animations on the "How It Works" section

### Mobile Considerations
- Hero CTA should be prominent on mobile
- FAQ should use accordion pattern
- Pricing section should be compact but clear
